# Browser Command

We are building a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game with multiplayer and mod support that will run in a browser. We have not yet decided on a theme for the game. Most modifiable games have a proprietary modding language that is rather hard to use so we wanted to develop a modifiable game that uses a widely-used programming language. Also in our group membersâ€™ experiences, we have never come across an RTS multiplayer game that runs in a browser so we wanted to develop that as well. Our game is for anyone who likes RTS games and likes to be able to modify their game to their liking.
